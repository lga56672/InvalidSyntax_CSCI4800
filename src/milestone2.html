                        <p><strong>A. Task/Problem Definition</strong></p>
                        <p class="milestone-2-list"> <strong>1.</strong> Piazza is an educational web-based platform that is used mainly in high-level education across the United States. 
                            Piazza was created as a way for students and instructors to interact to facilitate a better learning environment by using a forum-style interface. 
                            It allows for both students and instructors to share knowledge, ask questions, post notes, create discussions, and create assignments and due dates. 
                            Despite Piazza’s wide net of features offered as an interface, it has several fundamental flaws that can mitigate the learning capabilities behind it.
                            <br><br>  
                            Many issues can be seen with the current interface of Piazza that can cause various problems not only for the student but for the professors and TAs as well. 
                            While Piazza is highly utilized, the platform itself is not highly intuitive. At first glance, it is very overwhelming to look at, especially for those new to the platform. 
                            There is not an efficient way to navigate through the assignments to see which assignments are recent, important, or should be prioritized for a reply. 
                            Many of the buttons or icons don’t have an obvious affordance which prevents users from accessing many of the features that Piazza offers. 
                            <br><br> 
                            An example of how a user might interact with Piazza could be when a student tries to filter discussion posts in order to quickly check for any new posts from the instructor.
                             When they open Piazza they will see all of the posts and would then look for a signifier for the affordance of filtering.
                            The signifier is a button with a gear icon but this is not necessarily a commonly used icon for filtering and usually refers to settings so the student may not be able to find the correct button. 
                            They might click around on different things and try multiple different buttons or even check other pages before either giving up or finding the filtering button and completing their goal of viewing only the instructor posts.
                            A student in this situation could become frustrated by the extra time it takes them to find important information or by not being able to find the information at all. 
                            This interaction between the student and Piazza could deter them from using the platform again which leads to inequity when some students have more access to information/help than others. 
                            Users commonly use Piazza similarly to this student and filtering is a typical way to quickly find the information they need. 
                            Many similar websites and platforms allow filtering of posts and so users may expect Piazza to support the same function and attempt to use it.
                            <br><br> 
                            2. Students and professors are affected by Piazza’s usability. Students can ask questions, submit assignments, and create discussions. 
                            Professors can post assignments, create announcements, and answer students’ questions. 
                            Improving the function and interface of Piazza will increase students’ access to information/resources and make student-professor communication easier. 
                            It could increase student’s grades and reduce stress in all parties.
