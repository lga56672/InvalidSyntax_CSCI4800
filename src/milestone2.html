                        <p><strong>A. Task/Problem Definition</strong></p>
                        <p class="milestone-2-list"> <strong>1.</strong> Piazza is an educational web-based platform that is used mainly in high-level education across the United States. 
                            Piazza was created as a way for students and instructors to interact to facilitate a better learning environment by using a forum-style interface. 
                            It allows for both students and instructors to share knowledge, ask questions, post notes, create discussions, and create assignments and due dates. 
                            Despite Piazza’s wide net of features offered as an interface, it has several fundamental flaws that can mitigate the learning capabilities behind it.
                            <br><br>  
                            Many issues can be seen with the current interface of Piazza that can cause various problems not only for the student but for the professors and TAs as well. 
                            While Piazza is highly utilized, the platform itself is not highly intuitive. At first glance, it is very overwhelming to look at, especially for those new to the platform. 
                            There is not an efficient way to navigate through the assignments to see which assignments are recent, important, or should be prioritized for a reply. 
                            Many of the buttons or icons don’t have an obvious affordance which prevents users from accessing many of the features that Piazza offers. 
                            <br><br> 
                            An example of how a user might interact with Piazza could be when a student tries to filter discussion posts in order to quickly check for any new posts from the instructor.
                             When they open Piazza they will see all of the posts and would then look for a signifier for the affordance of filtering.
                            The signifier is a button with a gear icon but this is not necessarily a commonly used icon for filtering and usually refers to settings so the student may not be able to find the correct button. 
                            They might click around on different things and try multiple different buttons or even check other pages before either giving up or finding the filtering button and completing their goal of viewing only the instructor posts.
                            A student in this situation could become frustrated by the extra time it takes them to find important information or by not being able to find the information at all. 
                            This interaction between the student and Piazza could deter them from using the platform again which leads to inequity when some students have more access to information/help than others. 
                            Users commonly use Piazza similarly to this student and filtering is a typical way to quickly find the information they need. 
                            Many similar websites and platforms allow filtering of posts and so users may expect Piazza to support the same function and attempt to use it.
                            <br><br> 
                            2. Students and professors are affected by Piazza’s usability. Students can ask questions, submit assignments, and create discussions. 
                            Professors can post assignments, create announcements, and answer students’ questions. 
                            Improving the function and interface of Piazza will increase students’ access to information/resources and make student-professor communication easier. 
                            It could increase student’s grades and reduce stress in all parties.

                        <p class="milestone-2-list"> 
                            1. Reddit, which is an American social news aggregator, along with content rating, and discussion website, is also a forum-style interface. 
                            This is a site where users can join groups that share similar interests. Reddit is highly intuitive, and very simple to us and beginner friendly. 
                            Many users can ask questions within certain areas of interest and other users can respond or agree to the question. 
                            Reddit provides the capabilities of having upvotes in which users can agree to a post or answer that may resolve a question that a user may have. 
                            The piazza website which can be hard to navigate suffers from the lack of hierarchy. Within reddit, icons are clearly visible, and are each assigned a purpose. 
                            <br><br>
                            In Piazza, general features are on the same level as user content, and if a user clicks on a page all content is still visible, which makes it hard to distinguish what a user wants to find. 
                            Reddit solves this issue by organizing the forums in a style in which the original post is on the top, and only a few organized by upvotes are visible. 
                            If a user wants to get more involved, they also have the option by clicking “view more”, and upvote and downvote other responses and posts, giving users the freedom to take part in the environment without having to make a post. 
                            Reddit’s forums and spaces are designed to be created and led by the so called “moderators” of the forum. 
                            While reddit has it’s rules and guidelines, the “moderator” of this forum can determine what content can be allowed within their forum. 
                            This allows for users to have a subsequent control of the environment they create. 
                            <br><br>
                            Reddit also oversees forums by having strict guidelines in place for anything that may go against the guidelines in place. 
                            Reddit also has recently released a more intuitive version that is very user friendly, and allows for new users of the site to not be overwhelmed by the previous learning curve. 
                            In making reddits redesign reddit also took a look at its top 2000 communities and tracked the ideas and implementations that the moderators of the communities had done to customize the style of their community. 
                            Taking that feedback and looking into those things helped in determining the changes that needed to be made according to an article by Wired. 
                            Reddit also has an amazing feature in which users that prefer the old UI can change the look of the site to the “classic view”. 
                            Reddit utilizing the principles of looking at what their own users have done relates to the site's huge success.

                            2. eLC discussion pages are another option that would provide some advantages over the current use of Piazza. 
                            It would provide consistency for students because eLC is used for almost every single course throughout your time here at UGA. 
                            Not only that, but many professors currently utilize discussion pages and have categories to sort questions, important messages, and other types of responses. 
                            There would be a learning curve, and it does remove the capability for students to post responses only to the professor and TA(s), though it provides a much cleaner format, 
                            easier to sort through (so long as the settings are right on the discussion board), and a more consistent site use for students. 
                            Despite the pros, it is NOT a full replacement for Piazza, as it doesn’t provide all possible features to Piazza, such as the use of direct messaging the instructors and TA(s) 
                            as well as the capability to search posts (though this feature is a little wonky even with Piazza). 
                            <br><br>
                            Piazza has a few accessibility issues, such as color contrasting, which are necessary for those with low vision and color blindness. 
                            There are also issues for users who rely on keyboard-only navigation. eLC conforms to the Section 508 guidelines, which provide access to information that is similar to the access of others. 
                            eLC also allows those with disabilities to request specific accommodations as well as links to more accessibility information. 
                            Since eLC conforms to these guidelines, it also conforms to the guidelines necessary for good color contrast. 
                            eLC follows multiple design principles. For example, eLC follows the rules one and two from the Eight Golden Rules of Design, consistency and usability. 
                            eLC has a consistent color scheme, layout, and font. As stated before, it also provides resources for those with disability which aids in more universal usability.

                        <p class="milestone-2-list"> 
                            1. A design that would resolve Piazza’s issues would focus on usability and equity for students. 
                            To make a platform like Piazza more user-friendly, it would need to have signifiers that more obviously communicate their specific affordances, 
                            this could be accomplished through using recognizable icons and reorganizing the structure of the pages. 
                            Specific issues with usability like Piazza's filtering system can be resolved by adding filters that students would find more helpful and simplifying the interface 
                            to create a less confusing menu. For example, allowing a student to filter for “announcements” to exclude all other posts like assignments.
                            The color scheme would need to be adjusted to create a more equitable design, and options for magnification and keyboard navigation would be added. 
                            This would ensure students with disabilities can use the platform as much as other students. 
                            To accommodate students who use mainly mobile devices, the mobile app has to be improved and made functional for completing work.
                            <br><br> 
                            2. The best form of evaluation to ensure our design measures are successful is user testing with a sample of students and instructors. 
                            We can first have them run tests on the original Pizza web platform and the new design platform and evaluate the time it takes for them to run 
                            through tasks on both platforms. We can also do specific testing cases for those with difficulty seeing. We have provided many improvements to 
                            the layout and the website's color scheme that account for those with vision difficulties. We can also have them voice their opinion on their 
                            overall experience with the changes we made and if they would be more inclined to use the new version.
