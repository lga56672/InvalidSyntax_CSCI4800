                    Piazza is an educational web-based platform that is used mainly in high-level education across the United States. 
                    Piazza was created as a way for students and instructors to interact to facilitate a better learning environment by using a forum-style interface. 
                    It allows for both students and instructors to share knowledge, ask questions, post notes, create discussions, and create assignments and due dates. 
                    The idea behind Piazza was to create a so-called “Plaza,” where the word comes from, in which instructors and students can share and generate knowledge. 
                    On top of being an educational site, Piazza also offers opportunities to network through the Piazza Network portion of the site. 
                    This portion of the site allows students to put their job applications up and search for jobs, as well as connect with employers.  
                    Despite Piazza’s wide net of features offered, as an interface, it has several fundamental flaws that can mitigate the learning capabilities behind it. 
                    <br><br>
	                There are many issues that can be seen with the current interface of Piazza that can cause various problems not only for the student but for the graders of 
                    the assignments as well. While Piazza is highly utilized, the platform itself is not highly intuitive. At first glance, it is very overwhelming to look at, 
                    especially for those who are new to the platform. There is not an efficient way to navigate through the assignments to see which assignments are recent, 
                    important, or should be prioritized for a reply.  One other major issue that can be seen is how an individual is notified about replies and assignments. 
                    The interface itself is old-fashioned, and there isn't much differentiation between different aspects of the website making it difficult to find your way 
                    around the website and heavily affecting the readability and usability of the website. All these issues can make it even more difficult for individuals 
                    who may be affected by disabilities. 
                    <br><br>
                    The effects of Piazza’s design impacts both students and professors. When users initially access Piazza the interface can be difficult to navigate. 
                    This could dissuade students and professors from using the platform. Piazza’s disorganization can make it difficult for students to find the information 
                    they need. They might have trouble posting assignments or asking professors important questions. Students who are affected by disabilities might have other 
                    difficulties on top of these. Users who need to use keyboard navigation will struggle because Piazza does not make this easy. 
                    Magnification and color problems are also barriers that can keep students with vision problems from fully taking advantage of Piazza’s services or using 
                    the site at all. The situation becomes inequitable when some students do not have the same access to resources as others. All of these issues will impact 
                    students’ academic performance. This in turn can affect the mental health of students who might be doing better if they could access/use everything that 
                    Piazza has to offer. Professors are affected as well. All of these issues make it more difficult for them to communicate with their students. 
                    They may be trying to share important information but students are unable to find it or don’t even know it’s been posted.

                <p>
                    Piazza is an educational web-based platform used mainly in high-level education across the United States. Piazza was created as a way for students and 
                    instructors to interact to facilitate a better learning environment by using a forum-style interface. It allows students and instructors to share knowledge,
                    ask questions, post notes, create discussions, and create assignments and due dates. The idea behind Piazza was to create a so-called "Plaza," where the 
                    word comes from, in which instructors and students can share and generate knowledge. On top of being an educational site, Piazza also offers opportunities 
                    to network through the Piazza Network portion of the site. This portion of the site allows students to put their job applications up, search for jobs, and 
                    connect with employers. Despite Piazza's wide net of features offered, as an interface, it has several fundamental flaws that can mitigate the learning 
                    capabilities behind it.
                    <br><br>
                    The effects of Piazza's design impacts both students and professors. When users initially access Piazza, the interface can be challenging to navigate. 
                    This could dissuade students and professors from using the platform. The interface itself is old-fashioned, and there is not much differentiation between 
                    different aspects of the website leading to disorganization, making it challenging to find your way around the website, and heavily affecting the readability
                    and usability of the website. While there are plenty of signifiers for the different actions you can take on the site, they do not necessarily do a good job 
                    of communicating the action possibility they signify. For example, the lack of hierarchy in Piazza is a significant issue, and can be seen when general 
                    features in Piazza, such as "account settings" and "bug reports," can be seen on the same level as course pages. This affords user accessibility to 
                    information and costs navigation time and confusion. This leads to students not being able to attend classes properly because just navigating the course 
                    is a difficult task. Furthermore, there are multiple buttons with a "gear" icon, which is typically used for settings. One of these buttons is actually for 
                    filtering the discussions, and another is for settings. So the signifier does not match the affordance of "filtering." When a signifier is used twice for 
                    two different action possibilities, it can confuse the users going forward and complicate their navigation of Piazza. Due to Piazza's unorganized interface, 
                    students might have trouble posting assignments or asking professors important questions. 
                    <br><br>
                    Students affected by disabilities might have other difficulties on top of these. Users who need keyboard navigation will struggle because Piazza does not 
                    make this easy. For example, there is no way for a student to go back when navigating the left side of the page. Magnification and color problems are 
                    also barriers that prevent students with vision problems from fully taking advantage of Piazza's services or using the site. Like people with low vision 
                    who need good color contrast to read text. There are texts and buttons on Piazza's site that either do not meet the standards of Web Content Accessibility 
                    Guidelines 2.0 section 1.4.3 for visual design or would likely need an improvement in the contrast. This states that the contrast ratio must be at least 
                    4.5:1 with certain exceptions. When a note is created, an "Actions" button allows others to follow the note in case new discussions are added. 
                    It scored poorly when testing the color contrast and considering the text's size, especially for smaller texts. On Piazza's support page, the contact 
                    information under the search bar scored poorly. If someone with low vision tried to contact Piazza directly about an issue, they might not be able to see 
                    the contact information clearly. There are also forms of technology unavailability throughout the mobile app. While there is a mobile app for Piazza, it is 
                    even more challenging to navigate, and most students do not use it. This means that you need access to a computer to take full advantage of Piazza's 
                    capabilities. Some students may rely on a smartphone or tablet for school versus a laptop, which would make Piazza even less usable. 
                    <br><br>
                    The situation becomes inequitable when some students do not have the same access to resources as others. All of these issues will impact students' academic 
                    performance. This, in turn, can affect students' mental health, who might be doing better if they could access/use everything that Piazza offers. 
                    Professors are affected as well. All of these issues make it more difficult for them to communicate with their students. They may be trying to share 
                    important information, but students are unable to find it or do not even know it's been posted. While it is clear that both professors and students are 
                    affected, the impact on students is more detrimental. Professors may struggle to communicate with their students, but the many issues that students will 
                    run into can drastically affect their academic performance
