                We are the group, Invalid Syntax, for Dr. Michael Cotterell's CSCI 4800 class.

                For our project, we were tasked with taking a site heavily used in the learning environment and pointing out problems in its construction. We specifically took on Piazza. 
                This is a platform that many computer science majors are familiar with at UGA, and often is utilized by professors within the department. However, there are many aspects 
                that make Piazza a non-intuitive platform and hard to use for some if not most users. 
                <br> <br>
                This choice in project was spurred on by our own experiences with Piazza, and our desire to point out ways that it could be improved as you will find throughout this webpage!
