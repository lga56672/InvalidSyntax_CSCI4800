                <strong>User Story A)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a regular user, I want to filter posts in order to find important information related to
                    deadlines and assignment instructions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a filter option for upcoming deadlines
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a filter option for assignments vs announcements vs student questions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add tags to posts to organize them
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add deadlines to posts tagged as assignments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <strong>Wireframe justification for filters:</strong>
            This wireframe design was created because filters and tags that are easier to see can help students
            find the information that
            they are looking for and stay organized. Creating easily visible tags to better organize posts gives
            students an easier way to
            locate important information. These tags can then be used to filter for posts. Students can filter
            by specifics such as deadlines,
            questions, and instructor posts. The tags being visible and color coded helps to make the interface
            easier to navigate and
            allows for quicker use of Piazza when searching for information.

                <strong>User Story B)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>As a member of a group, I want to collaboratively work and edit a piazza post with other members of
                    the group at the same time
                </li>
                <li>
                    A group member can create a new post and invite those who then have the ability to edit
                </li>
                <li>
                    Autosaves posts to drafts to work on later
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <strong>Wireframe justification for collaborative:</strong>
            This wireframe design decision was made because a collaborative workspace helps with efficiency and
            productivity. Slack found that
            there was a 30% increase in the productivity of the team with a collaborative workspace. In a group
            it takes much longer for a
            single person to write down everything while everyone else is suggesting their ideas and many times
            ideas can be misinterpreted.
            This design alternative allows for users to press a button that says “invite people”, which then
            gives them the option to find other
            users within that forum or group and invite them to edit and collaborate on a post. When a user does
            so, this post is shared as a
            collaborative effort for others to see. This design idea works the best, because it allows for the
            initial user to press on the
            invite button. Then they can add and assign roles to the invited users.. This design change will
            help so the responsibility is
            not put on one person to write up the post, but will give everyone the ability to take a part in the
            assignment.

                <strong>User Story C)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    As a regular user, I want to understand Piazza’s layout so that I can navigate the site efficiently
                    and interact with others' posts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create buttons and icons with obvious affordances
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have a tutorial on how to use various features
                </li>
                <li>
                    Show an account users post at the top of the forum underneath the topic pinned, and have a “see
                    more” option instead of having all information shown at once.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>

                <strong>Wireframe justification for see more:</strong>
                This wireframe design serves the purpose of allowing for a more interactive UI in which users can
                immediately see
                replies and feedback from their own posts which are a part of the forum itself. Users would want to
                see what type of
                feedback they get instead of having to scroll to find where their post was created. With the pinned
                user posts a user can directly view both their post and responses without having to look for either.
                And instead of throwing all posts directly into a user's line of sight, the see more option allows
                for a user to
                have the option of reading more posts if they feel like doing so without the feeling of being
                overwhelmed.
                This see more option will open other posts based on responses and interactions as date posted.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is your research question? It should be simple, falsifiable, and related to the effectiveness
                    of your design in solving your problem of study.

                        <strong>
                            Would different UI and additional features serve to increase how users view and utilize
                            the Piazza site?
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    Based on your research question, what methodology will you use for testing and why? Some examples
                    include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Observation / Participant Observation.</li>
                        <li>Surveys.</li>
                        <li>Interviews.</li>
                        <li>Focus Groups.</li>
                        <li>Experiments.</li>
                        <li>Secondary Data Analysis / Archival Study.</li>
                        <li>Mixed Methods (combination of some of the above)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="padding-left:2em;">
                        <strong>
                            We would use a mix of methodologies, surveys and experiments. We would conduct an experiment
                            where users would test our website. The test would consist of instructions telling the user
                            to find something for example; find invite collaborators button. We would have users that
                            have utilized piazza before and see if our UI is easier to navigate and use than the
                            original. After conducting the experiment we would then provide a survey for the users to
                            fill out which would ask if it was easier/harder to navigate, what did you like/not like,
                            etc. Conducting an experiment and then getting feedback through a survey is a
                            straightforward way of seeing if our UI actually improved piazza or not, especially since we
                            would have test subjects that have used piazza before.

                    methodology, your testing procedure needs to involve your design prototype from (A). Also, be sure
                    to incorporate answers to the following questions in your description:

                        <li>

                                    For the experiment, we’ll time how long it takes for users to find something for
                                    example; if we wanted the user to find the invite collaborators button, we could
                                    time how long it takes for the users to find it. An issue we had with piazza was
                                    navigation so timing this would help see if our new UI helped improve the ability to
                                    navigate. We would also have the survey data which would help us figure out if our
                                    UI made it easier to use piazza or not based on the users’ feedback

                                    their given experiences. Taking the averages of ease of usage and responses would
                                    allow us to make a generalizations based on said responses in order to scale our
                                    next approach to the platform.
